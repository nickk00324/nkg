                    <p>
                        Nick Kochornswasdi Gallery is pleased to announce its first two-person exhibition with the Los Angeles-based artists
                        Kelly Wall and lydon frank, both artist’s first exhibition with the gallery. In <em>TALK MORE NOW</em>, Wall and frank inhabit
                        the roles of talk show hosts in a perpetual moment of introduction. The viewer is left waiting for the content to begin
                        just as it eventually comes to an end.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Within this disconnect that is created by the roles the artists are playing, they populate the work with a variety of
                        signs, symbols, and referents, including the characters themselves, to open up a space to call into question what each
                        of these tropes means and the role they play in current media.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ubiquitous coffee mugs, intro music, applause signs, and other staples of talk show television are stretched and
                        distorted to raise issues and questions related to the dissemination of news and media in the 21st century. <em>TALK MORE NOW</em> 
                        plays with time to create a focus on “filler” vs content to point to a media that is increasingly predisposed to an
                        endless “BREAKING NEWS” chyron, an image burned onto cheap televisions and also, the brain. Within this environment,
                        however, Wall and frank inject humor and sincerity to propose alternative modes of being, one that includes the politics
                        of communicating and community, listening and learning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to their collaborative work, Wall and frank have solo practices that follow their own idiosyncratic
                        tendencies that inform this exhibition, while remaining ideologically distinct.
                    </p>
