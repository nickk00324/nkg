                        Nick Kochornswasdi Gallery is pleased to present <em>Paintings By Diego</em>, an exhibition by the artist Diego Barrientos, his
                        first with the gallery. Barrientos works with medium to large-scale canvases and utilizes a variety of different
                        materials that are directly applied to the canvas to create mysterious textures that betray their unstretched form.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <em>Paintings by Diego</em> comprises a series of self-portraits created from 2018 to 2019. As the exhibition title’s literalness
                        suggests, it is an exhibition of Barrientos’ paintings. Questioning his relationship between the self and the work,
                        Barrientos frequently uses and presents his work as an actual product that one would use for comfort, warmth, and
                        protection. Implying the work is deeply personal while still being straightforwardly accessible. The paintings remain
                        unstretched in an effort to remind the viewer the materiality of the canvas and its potential functionality other than
                        the art object, with the hope that the viewer themselves will make their own art, because art is for everyone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The various shades of grey in his work references his time in the military and the experience of depersonalization. The
                        shapes and forms express the implications of alienation, longing, desire, despair, and pain, through a sliver of humor.
                        Multi-purpose parachute cords were applied directly onto the canvas and its skin-like textures suggest the self is also
                        an object. The exhibition proposes an intense working of complex human emotions while contemplating for a sense of
                        inclusivity and belonging.
                    </p>
